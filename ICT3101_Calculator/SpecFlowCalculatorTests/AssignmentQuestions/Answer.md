Enhance the Command Line Calculator to Support Advanced Quality Engineering Metrics and Models

This epic aims to extend the functionality of the existing command line calculator to meet the specialized needs of system quality engineers. By incorporating calculations for defect density, Shipped Source Instructions (SSI) in successive releases, and the Musa Logarithmic model for failure intensity and expected failures, the calculator will become a powerful tool for assessing and improving system quality.

**User Story 1: Calculate Defect Density**

- **As a** system quality engineer,
- **I want to** calculate the defect density of a system using the command line calculator
- **so that I can** efficiently assess the quality of the system and identify areas for improvement.

**User Story 2: Compute New Total SSI in Successive Releases**

- **As a** system quality engineer,
- **I want to** compute the new total number of Shipped Source Instructions (SSI) in successive releases using a single calculator command,
- **so that I can** effectively track changes in code size and complexity over time.

**User Story 3: Calculate Failure Intensity and Expected Failures Using Musa Logarithmic Model**

- **As a** system quality engineer,
- **I want to** calculate failure intensity and the expected number of failures using the Musa Logarithmic model via a single calculator command,
- **so that I can** predict system reliability and plan appropriate testing efforts.
